Connect Four:

Follows the standard rules Connect Four, However when placing a piece you will have to answer a question, which if answered incorrectly will instead place the opponent's colour piece.
For example the red player could be asked "What is 1+1?" and answer "7" leading there piece to turn yellow, this can lead to scenarios where if the player does not know what they are doing they could accidentally win the game for their opponent
